My first campaign as spokesman and strategist for Tony .lair was three years in the planning after he had become leader of the Opposition Labour Party. ,ome of the principles of strategy we applied back then would certainly apply to a modern day election. .ut their tactical execution almost certainly would not. Politicians and their strategists have to adapt to change as well as lead it. ,eguela gives some interesting insights into those who have adapted well, and those who have done less well. He clearly adores former President Lula of .razil and you can feel his yearning for a French leader who can somehow combine hardheaded strategy with human empathy in the same way as a man who left office with satisfaction ratings of eighty seven percent. ,eguela probably remains best known in political circles for his role advising Francois Mitterrand. Yet wheras I am tribal Labour, and could not imagine supporting a Conservative Party candidate in the UK, ,eguela came out as a major supporter of Nicolas ,arkozy. I wonder if one of the reasons was not a frustration that large parts of the left in France remain eternally suspicious of modern communications techniques and styles which, frankly, no modern leader in a modern democracy can ignore.
